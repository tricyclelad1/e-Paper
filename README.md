You can find the main code in: RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/. This has the twilight imperium factions + the JSON for updating the scoreboard. The main code is run from Trophy.py in the example folder. You can also find waveshare's original demo file in that folder for troubleshooting. The code could be edited easily depending on the e-ink screen you get from waveshare. For the JSON, Winner name should be 8 or 9 characters long to fit. Feel free to use anything in the title. The title values I've provided in the JSON are tested values that will work. Faction must be exact to pull the correct images for the winner. For runner-ups, factions use the suggested faction names provided.
Portraits are 225 x 300 or 3x4
Faction Symbols are 212 x 212 or 1x1
